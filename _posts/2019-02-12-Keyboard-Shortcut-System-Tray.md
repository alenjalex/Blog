We use the System Tray for a multitude of things.  
* To check the date and time
* To check the battery status
* To connect to Wi-Fi  
and the list goes on...

Did you know that we could use the keyboard to select the System Tray (_not the mouse_).

You could use `Windows Logo Key + B` to select the System Tray.  

<p align="left">
<img src="{{ "/assets/images/system-tray-icon.png"  | absolute_url }}" alt="System Tray Icon" align="middle"/>
</p>  
  
Once you press `Windows Logo Key + B`, the System Tray arrow icon is selected.  
You could then use the `Arrow Keys` to move the selection across. Once the selection is on the system tray arrow icon, you could press the `Space Bar` to open the hidden system tray icons and use the arrow keys to traverse across.  

This works for most versions of Windows.  
You can find more windows shortcuts at the Microsoft documentation [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12445/windows-keyboard-shortcuts).
